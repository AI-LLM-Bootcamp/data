Changelog
=========

0.17.0 (2018-08-20)
-------------------

- Make benchmarks script Py3 compatible. [Stefan Behnel]

- Add Go lang port. [iddober]

- Add reference to C# port. [ericcoleman]

- Chore: remove license header from files. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  The files should all inherit the projects license.


- Fix README title style. [Thomas Grainger]

- Add readme check. [Thomas Grainger]

  install docutils and Pygments


- Cache pip. [Thomas Grainger]

- Upgrade pip/setuptools for hypothesis. [Thomas Grainger]

- Feat: drop py26 and py33 support from tox. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

- Feat: drop support for 2.6 in test_thefuzz.py. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

- Feat: drop reference to 2.4 from readme. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

- Feat: drop py2.6 and py3.3 classifiers. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

- Feat: drop 2.6 and 3.3 support. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  These are no longer supported. Please upgrade your python version if you are using either version.

- Fuzz: _token_sort: check for equivalence. [Ralf Ramsauer]

  If we don't have to full_process the strings, we can safely assume to
  return 100 in case both candidates equal.

  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>


- Test: add more test cases. [Ralf Ramsauer]

  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>


- Utils: add and use check_for_equivalence decorator. [Ralf Ramsauer]

  And decorate basic scoring functions.

  The check_for_equivalence decorator MUST be used after the
  check_for_none decorator, as otherwise ratio(None, None) will get a
  score of 100.

  This fixes the first part of the recently introduced changes in the test
  set.

  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>


- Tests: add some corner cases. [Ralf Ramsauer]

  '' and '' are equal, so are '{' and '{'. Test if thefuzz gives them a
  score of 100.

  For the moment, this patch breaks tests, fixes in thefuzz follow.

  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>


- Utils: remove superfluous check. [Ralf Ramsauer]

  Decorators make sure that only non None-values are passed. We can safely
  assume that None will never get here.

  Other than that, None's shouldn't simply be ignored and erroneously
  changed to empty strings. Better let users fail.

  This commit doesn't break any tests.

  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>


- README: add missing requirements. [Ralf Ramsauer]

  pycodestyle and hypothesis are required for automatic testing. Add them
  to README's requirement section.

  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>


- Remove empty document. [Ralf Ramsauer]

  Signed-off-by: Ralf Ramsauer <ralf.ramsauer@oth-regensburg.de>

  https://github.com/seatgeek/thefuzz/issues/80

- Make process.extract accept {dict, list}-like choices. [Nathan
  Typanski]

  Previously, process.extract expected lists or dictionaries, and tested
  this with isinstance() calls. In keeping with the spirit of Python (duck
  typing and all that), this change enables one to use extract() on any
  dict-like object for dict-like results, or any list-like object for
  list-like results.

  So now we can (and, indeed, I've added tests for these uses) call
  extract() on things like:

  - a generator of strings ("any iterable")
  - a UserDict
  - custom user-made classes that "look like" dicts
    (or, really, anything with a .items() method that behaves like a dict)
  - plain old lists and dicts

  The behavior is exactly the same for previous use cases of
  lists-and-dicts.

  This change goes along nicely with PR #68, since those docs suggest
  dict-like behavior is valid, and this change makes that true.


- Merge conflict. [Adam Cohen]

- Improve docs for thefuzz.process. [Nathan Typanski]

  The documentation for this module was dated and sometimes inaccurate.
  This overhauls the docs to accurately describe the current module,
  including detailing optional arguments that were not previously
  explained - e.g., limit argument to extract().

  This change follows the Google Python Style Guide, which may be found
  at:

  <https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments>


0.5.0 (2015-02-04)

  Пайков]

------------------

- Fixed issue #59 - "partial" parameter for `_token_set()` is now
  honored. [Юрий Пайков]

- Catch generators without lengths. [Jeremiah Lowin]

- Remove explicit check for lists. [Jeremiah Lowin]

  The logic in `process.extract()` should support any Python sequence/iterable. The explicit check for lists is unnecessary and limiting (for example, it forces conversion of generators and other iterable classes to lists).
